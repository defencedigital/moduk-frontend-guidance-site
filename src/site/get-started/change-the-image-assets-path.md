If you use a different folder structure than `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`, you can
set a Sass variable. Once youâ€™ve set the variable, Sass will build the CSS to
point to your images folder.

Before the `@import` line in your Sass file, set `$moduk-images-path`. Set it to
the path of your images folder. For example:

```scss
$moduk-images-path: '/<YOUR-IMAGES-FOLDER>/';
```
