To use the components in the MOD.UK Design System, youâ€™ll need to set up MOD.UK
Frontend.

You can use MOD.UK Frontend to build digital services:

- in a production environment
- using [HMTL and CSS components](/components/)
- with Ministry of Defence branding
- consistent with the
  [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)

Our components are closely based on
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/)
components.

## How to set up MOD.UK Frontend

The [setup guide for developers](/get-started/setup-guide-for-developers/) shows
how to install using npm.

## Design library

MOD.UK Frontend components are also available in a design library in Figma.
