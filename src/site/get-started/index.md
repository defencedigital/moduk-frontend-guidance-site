You need to set up MOD.UK Frontend to use components in the MOD.UK Design
System.

You can use our components to build digital services:

- in a production environment
- using [HTML and CSS components](/components/)
- with Ministry of Defence branding
- consistent with the
  [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)

## How to set up MOD.UK Frontend

The [setup guide for developers](/get-started/setup-guide-for-developers/) shows
how to install MOD.UK Frontend using npm.

## Design Library

Our components are also available in the
[MOD.UK Figma Design Library](/get-started/design-library/).
