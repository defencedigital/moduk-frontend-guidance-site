Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "warning-text",
  exampleName: "default"
}) }}

[See GOV.UK warning text component guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/) for how it works.
