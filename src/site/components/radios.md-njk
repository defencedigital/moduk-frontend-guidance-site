Use the radios component when users can only select one option from a list.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "default"
}) }}

[See GOV.UK radios component guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/) for when not to use this component.

## How it works

[See GOV.UK radios component guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/) for detail on how this component works.

### If you’re asking one question on the page

If you are asking just [one question per page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) as recommended, you can set the contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "with-page-heading"
}) }}

### If you’re asking more than one question on the page

If you’re asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "not-as-page-heading"
}) }}

### Inline radios

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "inline"
}) }}

### Radio items with hints

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "with-item-hint"
}) }}

### Radio items with a text divider

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "with-divider-option"
}) }}

### Conditionally revealing a related question

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "with-conditional-reveal"
}) }}

### Smaller radios

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "small"
}) }}

### Error messages

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "radios",
  exampleName: "with-error-message"
}) }}
