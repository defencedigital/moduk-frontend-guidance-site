## How it works

[See GOV.UK pagination component guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/) for detail on how this component works.

### For smaller numbers of pages

Use ‘Previous’ and ‘Next’ links to let users navigate through a small number of pages. Stack the links vertically, so they’re more obvious to screen magnifier users when they’re zoomed in:

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "pagination",
  exampleName: "with-next-and-previous-only"
}) }}

#### Add link labels to describe pages

You can use link labels to give more context:

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "pagination",
  exampleName: "with-link-labels"
}) }}

### For larger numbers of pages

Use a list-type layout if users need to navigate through large numbers of pages. For example, long lists of search results.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "pagination",
  exampleName: "with-ellipses"
}) }}

#### First pages and last pages

Do not show the previous page link on the first page — and do not show the next page link on the last page.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "pagination",
  exampleName: "on-the-first-page"
}) }}

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "pagination",
  exampleName: "on-the-last-page"
}) }}
