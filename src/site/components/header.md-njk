The header component shows users they are on a Ministry of Defence site and which service they are using.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "header",
  exampleName: "default",
  iframe: true
}) }}

## When to use this component

You must use the header at the top of every page if your service uses MOD.UK Frontend.

## When not to use this component

You must not use the header if the general public will use your service.

## How it works

### Default header

Use the default header if your service has 5 pages or fewer.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "header",
  exampleName: "default",
  idSuffix: "default-2",
  iframe: true
}) }}

### Header with service name

Use the header with a service name if your service is more than 5 pages long - this can help users understand which service they are using.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "header",
  exampleName: "with-service-name",
  iframe: true
}) }}

### Header with service name and navigation

Use the header with navigation if you need to include basic navigation, contact or account management links.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "header",
  exampleName: "with-service-name-and-navigation",
  iframe: true
}) }}
