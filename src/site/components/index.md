Components are reusable parts of the user interface.

MOD.UK Frontend components are closely based on
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) components. We’ve
changed them so they’re suitable for internal Defence services – if your service
is not hosted on GOV.UK, you cannot use GOV.UK components without
[changing the font and logo](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk). 

We’ve changed the font in all the components and included the Ministry of
Defence logo in the header component.

We’ve also used MOD branding colours in the following components:

- header
- notification banner
- phase banner
- tag

Each MOD.UK Frontend component has coded examples. The components are accessible
and have been tested with users.

## Adapting components

You can adapt our components. Make sure you:

- follow the
  [GOV.UK design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles/)
- share what you are doing with the
  [MOD user-centred design community](https://servicemanual.digital.mod.uk/your-community/user-centred-design/)
- work with a User Researcher to test the designs

If you need components that are not in the MOD.UK Frontend or have feedback,
please email us at
[design-system@digital.mod.uk](mailto:design-system@digital.mod.uk).

## Design library

MOD.UK Frontend components are also available in a design library in Figma. You
can use these components for designing and prototyping user interfaces.
