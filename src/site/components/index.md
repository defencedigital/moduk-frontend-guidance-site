Components are reusable parts of the user interface.

MOD.UK Design System components are:

- based on [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
  components
- suitable for internal Defence services
- accessible and tested with users
- shown with coded examples

We’ve changed the font in all the components and included the Ministry of
Defence logo in the header component.

We’ve also used MOD branding colours in the following components:

- header
- notification banner
- phase banner
- tag

If your service is not hosted on GOV.UK, you cannot use GOV.UK components
without
[changing the font and logo](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk).

## Adapting components

You can adapt our components. Make sure you:

- follow the
  [GOV.UK design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles/)
- share what you are doing with the
  [MOD user-centred design community](https://servicemanual.digital.mod.uk/your-community/user-centred-design/)
- work with a User Researcher to test the designs

If you need components that are not in the MOD.UK Design System or have
feedback, email
[design-system@digital.mod.uk](mailto:design-system@digital.mod.uk).

## Design Library

Our components are also available in the
[MOD.UK Figma Design Library](/get-started/design-library/). You can use these
components for designing and prototyping user interfaces.
