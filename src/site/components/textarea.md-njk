Use the textarea component when you need to let users enter an amount of text that’s longer than a single line.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "textarea",
  exampleName: "default"
}) }}

## How it works

[See GOV.UK textarea component guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/textarea/) for detail on how this component works.

### If you’re asking one question on the page

If you’re asking just [one question per page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) as recommended, you can set the contents of the `<label>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "textarea",
  exampleName: "with-page-heading"
}) }}

### If you’re asking more than one question on the page

If you’re asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of the `<label>` as the page heading.

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "textarea",
  exampleName: "not-as-page-heading"
}) }}

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ guidanceComponentPreview({
  componentName: "textarea",
  exampleName: "with-error"
}) }}
